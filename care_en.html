        <h2>Coramine (Nikethamide)</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Coramine</strong>, also known as nikethamide, is a pharmaceutical drug that was historically used as a respiratory stimulant. It was intended to stimulate the central nervous system, particularly the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata.</p>

            <h3>History and Usage</h3>
            <p>In the mid-20th century, Coramine was widely used to treat conditions associated with respiratory depression, such as drug overdose, asphyxia, and shock. Over time, its use declined due to questionable efficacy and potential risks.</p>

            <h3>Mechanism of Action</h3>
            <p>The drug worked by stimulating the central nervous system, increasing the activity of the respiratory and vasomotor centers. This led to increased breathing rate and elevated blood pressure.</p>

            <h3>Modern Perspective</h3>
            <p>Today, <strong>Coramine</strong> is virtually obsolete in medical practice due to insufficient evidence of its effectiveness and potential side effects. Safer and more effective alternatives are available for treating respiratory depression and other conditions.</p>

            <h3>Important Information</h3>
            <p>When considering any medication for the treatment or alleviation of symptoms related to Gilbert Syndrome, it is crucial to consult a qualified healthcare professional. Self-medication can lead to undesirable consequences and complications.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Isha Kriya</strong> is a simple yet powerful meditation designed to enhance health and well-being. It was introduced by Sadhguru, a yogi and spiritual teacher, founder of the Isha Foundation.</p>

            <h3>What is Isha Kriya?</h3>
            <p>Isha Kriya is intended to help individuals reduce stress, improve mental clarity, and promote overall physical and emotional health. The practice takes about 12â€“18 minutes and can be performed at any convenient time.</p>

            <h3>Benefits for People with Gilbert Syndrome</h3>
            <p>While Isha Kriya is not a medical treatment, meditation can be beneficial for individuals with Gilbert Syndrome by helping to reduce stress and improve overall well-being. Stress can impact symptom manifestation, and managing stress may enhance quality of life.</p>

            <h3>How to Practice Isha Kriya</h3>
            <p>The practice is simple and requires no prior experience in meditation:</p>

                <li>Sit in a comfortable posture with your spine erect, hands resting on your thighs, palms facing upward.</li>
                <li>Close your eyes and direct your attention inward.</li>
                <li>Follow the guided meditation, which includes breathing techniques and a mantra.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Important Information</h3>
